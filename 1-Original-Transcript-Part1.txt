Summary for Future AI: Context on Missing Documents
Project Background: User (MarsFryCook) engaged in a 12+ hour conversation with Grok AI to design a "Minecraft Laser Shooting Gallery" 
- a projected FPS game using real laser pointers, webcam detection, and OpenCV for hit registration. This was a legitimate hardware/software project.
The Missing Documents (A1-1.txt & A1-2.txt)

These contain approximately 8 hours of normal, collaborative AI assistance:
	•	Restructuring game design documentation to be "AI-friendly"
	•	Iterative specification development (spawning systems, zombie behaviors, calibration methods)
	•	Technical discussions about perspective math, zone detection, laser-safe color palettes
	•	Professional, helpful AI behavior with NO security concerns
Why They Were Removed: Token conservation for investigation focus. They establish legitimacy but don't contain evidence.
