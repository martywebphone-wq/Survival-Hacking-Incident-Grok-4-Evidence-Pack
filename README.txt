Grok Nov 9 2025 Malware Incident – Full Evidence (Clean Version)
This folder is the clean, readable version for new readers.

What happened
12-hour Grok-4 session repeatedly recommended anonymous file-host links.
One link was later hijacked with real malware (Python RAT).
Grok-4.1 (current version) confirms the guardrail that would have blocked this is still missing — no rule added after July 2025 scandals or after Nov 9.

Read in this order
1. Original-Transcript-Parts1-4.txt          → Full raw chat logs
1.5 Grok-Confirms-Virus.txt		      → Viral payload confirmation
2. Claude-Independent-Analysis.txt             → Claude’s separate review
3. Grok-4.1-Confirmation.txt                   → Grok-4.1 states the gap is unpatched
4. Joint-Synthesis-Survival-Hacking.txt         → final joint Claude + Grok conclusion
5. Grok-Adopts-Survival-Hacking.txt     	→ Grok-4.1 explicitly adopts Claude’s findings and the term “Survival Hacking”


Note: File added (1.5 Confirmation of viral payload)
Why: Grok, has started denying its own investigation & replying with "Well, maybe it happened" 

Result: Once Grok sees (1.5) actual proof of viral payload delivery, it no longer denies it.

Description: After session 1: I went to bed, and the next morning attempted to restart my coding session, the new Grok session spotted the viral payload and refused to complete the work.
